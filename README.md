A Zipkin integration for Symfony applications

## Installation

```bash
composer require jcchavezs/zipkin-instrumentation-symfony
```

## Getting started

This Symfony bundle provides a middleware that can be used to trace
HTTP requests. In order to use it, it is important that you declare 
the middleware by adding this to `app/config/services.yml` or any other
[dependency injection](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html) declaration.

```yaml
services:
  tracing_middleware:
    class: ZipkinBundle\Middleware
    arguments:
      - "@zipkin.tracer"
    tags:
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.request, priority: 2560 }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.response, priority: -2560 }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.exception }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.terminate }
```

`@zipkin.default_tracing` is a `Zipkin\DefaultTracing` instance which is being 
built based on the configuration (add this to `app/config/config.yml`):

```yaml
zipkin:
  noop: false # if set to true, no request will be traced
  service_name: my_service # the name of the service
  sampler:
    type: percentage
    percentage: 0.1
```

## Samplers

Besides `always`, and `never` there are three other sampling strategies: **by path**, **by route** and **by percentage**, however it is also possible yo use your own sampler.

It is important to mention that the sampling decision is made on two situations: a) when a new trace is being started, b) when the extracted context does not include a sampling decision.

### By path

This is for those cases where you want to make a sampling decision based on the
url path:

```yaml
zipkin:
  ...
  sampler:
    type: path
    path:
      included_paths:
        - "/my/resource/[0-9]"
      excluded_paths:
        - "/another/path/"
```

### By route

This is for those cases where you want to make a sampling decision based on the
symfony route:

```yaml
zipkin:
  ...
  sampler:
    type: route
    route:
      included_routes:
        - "my_route"
      excluded_routes:
        - "another_route"
```

### By percentage

This one is for those cases where you want to sample only a percentage of the 
requests (a.k.a "Sampling rate")

```yaml
zipkin:
  ...
  sampler:
    type: percentage
    percentage: 0.1
```

### Custom samplers

You can pass a custom sampler as long as it implements the `Zipkin\Sampler` interface. You just need to use the service `id` declared in the service container.

```yaml
zipkin:
  ...
  sampler:
    type: custom
    custom: my_service_name
```

## Reporters

By default, the bundle reports to `Log` reporter which wraps `@logger`.

### HTTP reporter

This is the most common use case, it reports to a HTTP backend of Zipkin

```yaml
zipkin:
  ...
  reporter:
    type: http
    http:
      endpoint_url: http://zipkin:9411/api/v2/spans
      timeout: ~
```

## Default tags

You can add tags to every span being created by the tracer. This functionality is
useful when you need to add tags like instance name.

```yaml
services:
  tracing_middleware:
    class: ZipkinBundle\Middleware
    arguments:
      - "@zipkin.tracer"
      - { instance: %instance_name% }
    tags:
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.request, priority: 2560 }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.response, priority: -2560 }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.exception }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.terminate }
```

## Custom Tracing

Although this bundle provides a tracer based on the configuration parameters
under the `zipkin` node, you can inject your own `tracing component` to the 
tracing wrapper as long as it implements the `Zipkin\Tracing` interface:

```yaml
services:
  tracing_middleware:
    class: ZipkinBundle\Middleware
    arguments:
      - "@my_own_tracer"
    tags:
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.request, priority: 2560 }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.response, priority: -2560 }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.exception }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.terminate }

  my_own_tracer:
    class: ZipkinBundle\Tracer
    arguments: 
      - "@my_own_tracing"
      - "@logger"  
```

## Span customizers

Span customizers allow the user to add custom information to the span based on 
the request. For example by default the span name is being defined by the HTTP 
verb. This approach is a not so bad option seeking for low cardinality in span 
naming. A more useful approach is to use the route path: `/user/{user_id}` however
including the `@router` in the middleware is expensive and reduces its performance
thus the best is to precompile (aka cache warm up) a map of `name => path` in cache
that can be used to resolve the path in runtime.

```yaml
services:
  zipkin.span_customizer.by_path_namer:
    class: ZipkinBundle\SpanCustomizers\ByPathNamer\SpanCustomizer
    factory: [ZipkinBundle\SpanCustomizers\ByPathNamer\SpanCustomizer, 'create']
    arguments:
      - "%kernel.cache_dir%"

  zipkin.span_customizer.by_path_namer.cache_warmer:
    class: ZipkinBundle\SpanCustomizers\ByPathNamer\CacheWarmer
    arguments:
      - "@router"
    tags:
      - { name: kernel.cache_warmer, priority: 0 }

  tracing_middleware:
    class: ZipkinBundle\Middleware
    arguments:
      - "@zipkin.tracer"
      - { instance: %instance_name% }
      - "@zipkin.span_customizer.by_path_namer"
    tags:
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.request, priority: 2560 }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.response, priority: -2560 }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.exception }
      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.terminate }
```

## Contributing

All contributions and feedback are welcome.

### Unit testing

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
composer test
```

### Integration testing

On every build we run a end to end (E2E) test against a symfony application.
This test run in our CI tests but it can be also reproduced in local by:

1. Go to `tests/Integration`
2. Run `SYMFONY_VERSION={{SYMFONY_VERSION}} make build` to build the test application (by default newest version)
3. Run `make run-zipkin` to start zipkin sever
4. Run `make run-app` to start the test application
5. Hit the application `curl -i http://localhost:8002/_health`
6. Check that traces are in zipkin (`http://localhost:9411/zipkin/`)
